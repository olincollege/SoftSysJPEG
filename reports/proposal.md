1. The goal of our project is to create a JPEG compression and decompression script using the discrete cosine transform and image data encoding techniques. Our lower bound that we are confident we can achieve is importing an image and passing it through existing compression libraries. Our stretch goal is to implement the math for compression and decompression ourselves from scratch (using matrix math). We will define a very successful project as one in which we are able to create a compression algorithm that is as efficient as existing techniques.
2. Our main learning goals are to understand data compression, understand image processing, using C to parse and process image data, and learning how to do complex math in C (matrix functions).
3. To get started, we have found a few introductory tutorial videos that we will use to understand our problem and chart out a basic implementation. From there, we will improve upon our implementation by learning more about matrix math in C and possible optimizations as well as different JPEG compression techniques that may be more fruitful.
4. Right now, we will break down JPEG data files and understand how they work, implement the discrete cosine transform, and find an existing compression library. Krishna will work on the first task, Merwan will work on the last, and we will both collaborate to implement the discrete cosine transform.
