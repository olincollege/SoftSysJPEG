# Project 1 Update
Krishna Suresh and Merwan Yeditha

**1. What is the goal of your project?**
The goal of our project is to create a program that can take in a bitmap image and compress it using JPEG-compression techniques so that the image can appear comparable while taking up less storage space.

**2. What are your learning goals?**
At a base level, we both wish to gain skills using C, especially with regards to using pointers and writing programs with object-oriented structure. Additonally, we want to gain experience using off-the-shelf libraries in C and creating programs using existing documentation for matrix math libraries. Finally, we want to explore the implementation of huffman encoding as we are both familiar with it but do not have much experience on the implementation end.

**3. What have you done to get started?**
To get started, we have understood the concepts behind JPEG-encoding, including:
    - The protocol with which they are stored
    - The discrete cosine transform
    - Quantization and huffman encoding
    - Subsampling
We have also implemented a few of these functions, such as quantization, the discrete cosine transform, transformation from RGB to YCbCr colorspace, and unpacking the JPEG protocol.

**4. What are you working on now?**
Right now, we are working on formalizing our functions to compute the DCT and apply the transformation to the matrix and integrating our functions to create a fully working program.
